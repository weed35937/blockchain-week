description = '''
The energy of club music serves as a vessel for his own feelings and a tool to manipulate others with. The spectrum of moods expressed – in his productions, DJ sets and on his label Disco Inferno – veers from nostalgia and passion to loneliness, melancholia and brutality, often juxtaposing darkness and light in the same pulse as an authentic conduit of his own artistic self-assessment. I Hate Models will shock #ROXYprague for the first time on Friday 9/6.
