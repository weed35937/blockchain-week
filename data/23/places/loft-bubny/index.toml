We are a loft-style daylight photography studio. 
We have 5 meters high ceilings, a total of about 400m2 of space in two separate studios, large windows with plenty of natural light and a good location in Prague's Holešovice. Possibility of parking in the courtyard of the building.

BUB-NY studio is designed in the spirit of American lofts with industrial elements. It's a great place for shooting or filming your projects.
