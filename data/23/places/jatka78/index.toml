description = '''
A multifunctional theatre hall as well as a small-scale theatre space, a training hall and a rehearsal space, a gallery and a bar. Jatka78 has it all, offering ideal conditions for the genres of contemporary circus, dance as well as non-verbal, alternative and puppet theatre. It is a residency space of the companies Cirk La Putyka, Heaven's Gate and DEKKADANCERS, a space open to Czech and international creation alike, one perfectly adapted to creative residencies, shows, workshops, conferences, discussions, lectures, exhibitions and happenings. We also operate our summer stage in the Azyl78 big top.
