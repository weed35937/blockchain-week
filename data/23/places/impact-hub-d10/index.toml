description = '''
The building of the former printing house in Smíchov surprises with its diversity and articulation. On two floors you can look forward to a large open space, colourful meeting rooms with large windows to the courtyard, offices, quiet corners for concentrated work, a chillout zone for relaxation and a terrace for summer barbecues. Because details matter, the space is complemented by a self-service bar, Wiesner & Hager designer furniture, wooden log flooring or hanging kokedams.
