Buckle up! This is a big one. Coming to the STRV stage are Metaverse & NFT advisor Diego Borgo, VW Group NFT/Metaverse expert & TEDx speaker Tim Walther; LTD.INC CEO & serial entrepreneur Daryl Kelly; and POAP Studio co-founder Sebastian Orellano.

You’re invited to STRV Talks, a must-attend for Web3, NFT and Metaverse buffs. Moderated by Lubo Smid (STRV co-founder/CEO) and Luca Zicconi (Web3 Studio Lead at Škoda Auto), the event will feature a panel talk with heavy hitters — making it the perfect opportunity to learn and ask any burning questions you may have.

But it's not all about the panels. We'll be hosting a networking event at STRV’s rooftop bar in Karlin to keep the discussions going.
