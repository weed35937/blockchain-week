description = '''
Urbit is a new kind of computer that you can own completely in ways that matter: networking, identity, & data.

​We realized that in order to fix the internet, we had to build a new computer from scratch. Good thing we started over a decade ago.

​Today, Urbit is a real system with thousands of users that are building all kinds of communities, software, DAOs, and more. And it’s getting better every day.

---

​The meetup takes place as part of the [L2Loft](https://explore.prgblockweek.com/23/event/l2loft) initiative.
