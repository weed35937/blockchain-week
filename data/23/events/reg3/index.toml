The Reg3 Conference is a not-for-profit, two-day annual crypto policy summit with a particular focus in the European Union.

To further improve the dialogue between the industry and regulators in the various European countries, Reg3 now allows national organisations to organise a fork of its main event.

In the case of Prague we're proud of contributing towards a more nuanced understanding of this new digital technology.
