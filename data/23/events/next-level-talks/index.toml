The event will feature a panel talk with expert speakers, moderated by the STRV and Enter.xyz CEO, Lubo Smid. It's the perfect opportunity to learn from the best and ask any burning questions you might have.


But it's not all about the panels. We'll be hosting a networking event at the rooftop bar for your chance to meet other Web3, NFT, and Metaverse enthusiasts. So don't miss out!
