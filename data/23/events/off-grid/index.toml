description = '''
OFF/GRID is an experiment in autonomy & collective intelligence. We will converge in one of the most exciting spaces in Prague for a day and night of DAO shenanigans. Our goal is to learn & share our ideas and practices from across the DAO and cryptospace & engage in deep critical discussion & collaboration on how to drive the DAO space forward.

Dr. Nick / FactoryDAO Protocol Leader
