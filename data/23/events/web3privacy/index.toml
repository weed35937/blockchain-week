A one-day lunarpunk-style conference focused on privacy. First ever [Web3Privacy Summit](https://github.com/web3privacy/w3ps) #1.

---

If privacy is a human right, then we need to protect it.
  
Privacy advocates worldwide are coming together to discuss how to mainstream privacy within the Web3 industry. So it will become a cultural phenomenon embodying both decentralisation & anti-surveillance capitalism practices.
  
The conference complements the research project [Web3Privacy Now](http://web3privacy.info/) and was created by joining forces with the production team of the privacy hackathon [ETHBrno](https://ethbrno.cz/).
