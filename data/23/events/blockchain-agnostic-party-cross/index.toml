Welcome to the Blockchain AGNOSTIC Party 2023!

Starting at 8pm, join us for exceptional food and delightfully chilled tank beer at our first-floor restaurant.

This is followed by the musical talents of British drum and bass artists duo Basslayerz, with music production kicking off from 10pm.

Your ticket price includes entry to the music production, a welcome drink, a merchandise gift, and reserved seating in the restaurant before the concert.

Our goal is to facilitate engaging conversations among attendees of the BTC Prague conference and Prague Blockchain Week. As such, the event will only proceed if we register a minimum of five participants, a status update that will be provided here, on the event page. If we do not gather enough attendees, the event will be cancelled and all previously purchased tickets will be refunded, with updates also made available on the event page.

Purchase your tickets with Bitcoin! Utilize this https://mainnet.demo.btcpayserver.org/apps/4E6d24S2qcu1sm3fzq6uxiuJdrxm/pos BTCpay link for ticket purchases through BTC.

It is also possible to purchase your ticket by acquiring an NFT from selected collections. Purchase an NFT from one of the collections listed at the end of the text and receive free entry, as well as permanent access to over 100 channels on Discord and discounts for future IRL events organized by us. We extend our gratitude to Tokenproof for enabling this opportunity.

We invite you to dine, engage in conversation, and then dance the night away to extraordinary drum and bass music!

If you've met someone at the conference you'd like to converse with privately, please write to us https://t.me/nftiology_events or http://nftiology.tech and we will arrange a separate reservation for you away from the crowd.
