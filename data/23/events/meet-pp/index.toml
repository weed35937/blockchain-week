Hello and welcome to Prague!

Meet Paralelní Polis, home of the legendary Institute of Cryptoanarchy, Hackers Congress Paralelní Polis, Prague DeFi Summit, ETHPrague, and Pizza Day Prague!

Your host for the night will be Mário Havel, a hacker, and researcher focused on making the crypto ecosystem more efficient and anonymous. Mário educates about tools of cryptoanarchy in local communities with a focus on onboarding via Lightning and p2p exchange. He is a vast enjoyer of FOSS, parallel economy, and trolling bitcoiners.

Mário will tell you everything you need to know about the parallel polis concept, show you around our majestic 4 story building and showcase how the parties are done at the infamous Bordel Hackerspace.

We are looking forward to meeting you all!

If you are interested, please register on the [Paralelní Polis website](https://www.paralelnipolis.cz/#kalendar).
