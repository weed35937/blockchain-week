As the Bitcoin technology matures and gains wider adoption, issues such as regulation, centralization, and privacy concerns arise, potentially undermining the very principles that inspired its creation: a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash that would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.

Contemplating regulation, cheering up for bitcoin ETF or state and institutional adoption: all of these issues have far diverged from bitcoin's original vision. How could we have allowed this to happen?

Noisy keyboard warriors won't win us the real fight ahead of us: The Crypto Wars 2.0. How to arm up?

Cypherpunks don't ask for permissions.

Cypherpunks don't care about regulation.

Cypherpunks build tools to allow new societal structures to emerge.

Come and meet to discuss how to bring back the spirit and principles of the movement and shift the power struggle right back where it belongs: the hands of the users!
